## üì¶ Installation and Setup

To get a local copy running, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikocherovets/react_book-store.git
```
### 2. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or later):

```bash
node -v
```

### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Setup and Run the Backend (json-server):
Setting up the backend is mandatory to add, edit, and delete books. **Make sure to keep the json-server running in a separate terminal while working with the app.** Do not close this terminal window, as the backend server needs to stay active while using the app.

```bash
npm install -g json-server
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

### 5. Run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```
